Time Tracking Program For Nana

The program asks Nana to input the start date and time in the format [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]. But more efficiently asks Nana to ENTER 'NOW' TO USE THE CURRENT TIME.

Then asks him to Enter stop date and time also in the format [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]

The program calculates the hours he spent on a task multiplies it with the expected rates

It then gives Nana the amount of money he made tackling the task. 

The time entered and output from the program is stored in a csv/excel file(name:nana) with headings(START_DATE_&_TIME, STOP_DATE_&_TIME, HOURS_SPENT,AMOUNT_MADE)for future referencing.
